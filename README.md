This is repository for the Assignment 15 given by my respected teacher. This Assignment is solely made by me Everyday I work on this assignment and each day I am getting closer to complete this assignment. It helps me clearing my operating system conecpts in more advaced. I have not learn concept of os this deep.

Question43:

 A page-replacement algorithm should minimize the number of page faults. We can do this
minimization by distributing heavily used pages evenly over all of memory, rather than having
them compete for a small number of page frames. We can associate with each page frame a
counter of the number of pages that are associated with that frame. Then, to replace a page, we
search for the page frame with the smallest counter.
a. Write a page-replacement program using this basic idea. Specifically address the problems of
(1) what the initial value of the counters is, (2) when counters are increased, (3) when counters
are decreased, and (4) how the page to be replaced is selected.
b. How many page faults occur for your algorithm for the following reference string, for four
page frames( take page frame size from user, Mention details might be use for testing) ? 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 5, 4, 5, 4, 2.
c. What is the minimum number of page faults for an optimal page- replacement strategy for the
reference string in part b with four page frames( result should be dependent upon frame entered
by user as described in part b)?
